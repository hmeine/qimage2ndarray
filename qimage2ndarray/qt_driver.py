"""This module contains a wrapper around three different Qt python bindings.
It will dynamically decide which one to use:

* First, the environment variable QT_DRIVER is checked
  (may be one of 'PyQt5', 'PyQt4', 'PySide', 'PythonQt').
* If unset, previously imported binding modules are detected (in sys.modules).
* If no bindings are loaded, the environment variable QT_API is checked
  (used by ETS and ipython, may be 'pyside' or 'pyqt').

In order to have compatible behavior between the different bindings,
PyQt4 (if used) is configured as follows::

    sip.setapi("QString", 2)
    sip.setapi("QVariant", 2)

Furthermore, there is a 'getprop' function that solves the following
problem: PythonQt exports Qt properties as Python properties *and*
gives the precedence over getters with the same name.  Instead of
calling getters with parentheses (which must not be used in PythonQt,
but are required in PyQt and PySide), one may e.g. write
`getprop(widget.width)`.
