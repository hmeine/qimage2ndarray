qimage2ndarray
==============

qimage2ndarray is a small python extension for quickly converting
between ``QImages`` and ``numpy.ndarrays`` (in both directions).  These are
very common tasks when programming e.g. scientific visualizations in
Python using PyQt4 as the GUI library.

* Supports conversion of scalar and RGB data, with arbitrary dtypes
  and memory layout, with and without alpha channels, into ``QImages``
  (e.g. for display or saving using Qt).

* qimage2ndarray makes it possible to create ``ndarrays`` that are
  *views* into a given QImage's memory.

  This allows for very efficient data handling and makes it possible
  to modify Qt image data in-place (e.g. for brightness/gamma or alpha
  mask modifications).

* qimage2ndarray is stable and unit-tested:

  * proper reference counting even with views (ndarray.base_ points to
    the underlying QImage)

  * handles non-standard widths and respects QImage's 32-bit row
    alignment

* `Masked arrays`_ are also supported and are converted into QImages
  with transparent pixels.

* Supports recarrays_ (and comes with an appropriate dtype) for
  convenient access to RGB(A) channels.

* Supports value scaling / normalization to 0..255 for convenient
  display of arbitrary NumPy arrays.

* Recent additions are convenient image loading / saving methods
